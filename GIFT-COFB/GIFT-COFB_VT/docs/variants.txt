Notation:
Na, Nm, Nc: the number of blocks of associated data,
plaintext, and ciphertext, respectively

v1: GIFT-COFB v1.0
ash
a. Design goal
Support for authenticated encryption, decryption.
Basic iterative architecture to optimize throughput to area ratio.
No BRAMs, no DSP units.
All RAMs using asynchronous read.

b. Supported maximum sizes of inputs
Not evaluated.

c. Reference software implementation

giftcofb128v1

d. Non-default values of generics and constants
None

e. Block sizes

AD block size = 128 bits
Plaintext/Ciphertext block size = 128 bits

f. Execution times

Execution Time for Encryption:
60 + 49*Na + 47*Nm + ((Nm<>0)&&(Na==0))*45

Execution Time for Decryption:
61 + 49*Na + 47*Nm + ((Nm<>0)&&(Na==0))*45

g. Difference between execution times for a new key and the same key
8
