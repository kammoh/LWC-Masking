Notation:
Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : the number of complete blocks of associated data,
plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc, Inh : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of
the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc, Blh : the number of bytes in the incomplete block of
associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively.

v1: Schwaemm256128 (AEAD only)

a. Design goal
Support for authenticated encryption, decryption.
Basic iterative architecture to optimize throughput to area ratio.
No BRAMs, no DSP units.
All RAMs using asynchronous read.

b. Supported maximum sizes of inputs
Not evaluated.

c. Reference software implementation

schwaemm256128v1

d. Non-default values of generics and constants
None

e. Block sizes

AD block size = 256 bits
Plaintext/Ciphertext block size = 256 bits

f. Execution times

Execution Time for Encryption:
        38*Na + 47*Nm + 97

Execution Time for Decryption:
        38*Na + 47*Nc + 98

g. Difference between execution times for a new key and the same key
Not evaluated.
